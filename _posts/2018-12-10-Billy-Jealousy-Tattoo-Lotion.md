## Billy Jealousy Tattoo Lotion

 When you're done getting your tattoo, the tattoo artist would usually put some sort of finishing lotion. The reason for putting on lotion or ointment after getting you're tattoo is to prevent bacteria from getting into your skin and it also protects the tattoo from rubbing on your clothes and getting irritated. I would use Billy Jealousy Tattoo Lotion as an option.


## Pros and Cons

 One thing I like about this product is that it helps prevent ink discoloration. Hydrates and tones for better color. Exfoliates and encourages cell turnover. One thing I don't like about the prodcut is that the heavy floral scent might be overwhemling to some people. I also don't like that it's kinda expensive for some people. For one bottle, which is 8 fl. oz, it's around $20.00 .

  Another option is Aquaphor Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment. I like this product because it hydrates the skin and prevents dryness. I also like that you can get a 14 fl. oz, around $12.00 .
